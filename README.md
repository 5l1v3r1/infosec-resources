##Intro
TL;DR - View the list [here](/infosec-resources.md)!

This repository contains a list of useful infosec resources. This list is on GitHub to encourage pull-requests and contributions!

###How To Contribute
Please don't hesitate to send a pull request! Contributing is easy and encouraged! To contribute, simply do the following:
- [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- Read the [TODO](/TODO.md) file (Adding new resources is my #1 priority, but things like Alphabetizing and adding/removing resources are important, too.)
- Edit the list (we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change)
- [Send a PR](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

**Small commits are preferred, where possible, to help organize and maintain modifications.**
